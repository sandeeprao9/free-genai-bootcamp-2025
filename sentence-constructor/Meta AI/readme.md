# initial observations

## Model details
Model Used by metaAI was Llama 3.1 with 13 B parameters


## Observations
While intially as the prompt mainly allowed to be accommodate for all difficulty level, it became very verbose but still not giving clear idea on how someone can translate the sentense

After tweaking a bit the breakdown became concise spl after limiting on how the responses should be formatted , also adjusted the difficuly level allowed better explanation

## the newer models obeviously provides much richer response and also have better accurancy in translation

E.g. in my study I was using French as target language and one of the mistake which I saw llama 2.0 did was using des ours (which is indefinitive and may mean some of few) but if you see the original sentense we used was just "Bears are at the door.." which might generally have 'the' as in 'the bear' as article which means the right article should have been 'les' which was correctly guessed by llama 3 and llama 3.1 model

Another exmaple is the latest version are also suggesting more gramatical aspects like tense, spl understanding the sentense and it possible tense (in our case the bears are already at door and the garbage was left out side in past), which was better explained in llama 3.0 and llama 3.1 model

Let's break down the sentence "Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?" and explore how to translate it into French.
English Sentence Structure
The sentence consists of two parts: a statement ("Bears are at the door") and a question ("did you leave the garbage out?"). In English, this is a common way to express concern or surprise.
French Translation
The French translation would be:
"Des ours sont à la porte, est-ce que tu as laissé les ordures dehors ?"
Key Differences
Here are the key differences between the English and French sentences:
"Bears" becomes "des ours" (note the use of the indefinite article "des" instead of "the").
"are at the door" becomes "sont à la porte" (the verb "are" is translated to "sont", and "at the door" becomes "à la porte").
"did you leave" becomes "est-ce que tu as laissé" (the verb "did" is translated to "est-ce que", and "leave" becomes "laisser").

The verb "laisser" (to leave) is often used in the context of leaving something behind, as in "as-tu laissé les ordures dehors ?".
In French, it's common to use the formal "vous" instead of the informal "tu" when speaking to someone you don't know well.

French Translation and Explanation
Let's break down the English sentence "Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?" and explore its French equivalent.
The English sentence is a great example of a complex sentence, which includes a main clause ("Bears are at the door") and a subordinate clause ("did you leave the garbage out?"). In French, we can translate this sentence to:
"Les ours sont à la porte, est-ce que vous avez laissé les ordures dehors?"
Now, let's analyze the differences between the two languages:
Word order: In English, the word order is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), whereas in French, the word order is also SVO, but with some variations. For example, in French, the verb "être" (to be) is often used as a linking verb, and the sentence structure can change accordingly.
Verb conjugation: The verb "are" in English is a present tense verb, which is translated to "sont" in French (third person plural present tense). The verb "did leave" in English is a past tense verb, which is translated to "avez laissé" in French (second person plural past tense).
Vocabulary: Some words have different translations in French, such as:
"Bears" = "Les ours"
"Garbage" = "Les ordures"
"Door" = "La porte"
Idiomatic expressions: The phrase "did you leave the garbage out?" is an idiomatic expression in English, which is translated to "est-ce que vous avez laissé les ordures dehors?" in French. The word "dehors" (outside) is added to indicate the location of the garbage.
Vocabulary Building
To help you build your French vocabulary, here are some additional words related to the sentence:
Les ours (bears)
La porte (door)
Les ordures (garbage)
Dehors (outside)
Laisser (to leave)
Grammar Focus
In this sentence, we used the following grammar concepts:
Present tense: "Les ours sont à la porte" (The bears are at the door)
Past tense: "est-ce que vous avez laissé les ordures dehors?" (Did you leave the garbage out?)
Subordinate clause: "est-ce que vous avez laissé les ordures dehors?" (Did you leave the garbage out?)
I hope this explanation helps you understand the differences between English and French, and builds your vocabulary and grammar skills in French!

Model llama 3.0 13B

French Translation and Explanation
The English sentence "Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?" can be translated to French as:
"Les ours sont à la porte, est-ce que tu as laissé les ordures dehors ?"
Breakdown of the Sentence
Let's break down the sentence to understand the differences between English and French:
"Bears" becomes "Les ours" in French. Notice that the French word for "bears" is "ours", and the definite article "les" is used to indicate that we are talking about a specific group of bears.
"are at the door" becomes "sont à la porte" in French. The verb "are" is translated to "sont" (third person plural of the verb "être"), and the preposition "at" is translated to "à".
"did you leave" becomes "est-ce que tu as laissé" in French. This is an example of a question in the past tense, using the verb "laisser" (to leave). The phrase "est-ce que" is used to form a question, and "tu as" is the second person singular of the verb "avoir" (to have) in the present perfect tense.
"the garbage" becomes "les ordures" in French. The word "garbage" is translated to "ordures", and the definite article "les" is used again to indicate that we are talking about a specific type of garbage.
"out" becomes "dehors" in French. This is an adverb that indicates the location outside.
Vocabulary Building
Some key vocabulary words to remember from this sentence are:
Ours (bears)
Porte (door)
Ordures (garbage)
Dehors (outside)
Laisser (to leave)
Grammar Explanation
In French, the sentence structure is often different from English. In this sentence, we use the verb "sont" (are) in the present tense to describe the location of the bears, and the verb "as laissé" (did you leave) in the present perfect tense to ask about a past action. The use of the definite article "les" and the adverb "dehors" also helps to clarify the meaning of the sentence.
English Language Construction
In English, the sentence "Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?" is an example of a complex sentence, with two independent clauses joined by a comma. The first clause "Bears are at the door" is a statement, and the second clause "did you leave the garbage out?" is a question. The use of the comma helps to separate the two clauses and indicate that they are related.
Comparison of English and French
In French, the sentence "Les ours sont à la porte, est-ce que tu as laissé les ordures dehors ?" is also a complex sentence, but the word order is different from English. In French, the verb "sont" (are) comes after the subject "les ours" (the bears), whereas in English, the verb "are" comes after the subject "bears". Additionally, the French sentence uses the phrase "est-ce que" to form a question, whereas the English sentence uses the verb "did" to form a question.
I hope this explanation helps you understand the differences between English and French, and builds your vocabulary and grammar skills!
